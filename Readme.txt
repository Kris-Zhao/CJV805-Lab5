Reflection:
This is a java web project for creating a Coffee Shop online order, which uses Java Server Faces. It has
an index.xhtml as the View and an Orderbean class as the Model. The controller is a facesservlet configured by
JSF framework. 

In index.xhtml, I created one form where some tables are defined as the required mock-up screens, like some drop-down lists,
radio buttons and "Place order" button. The Orderbean class will render the quantity numbers entered by the user and also
return a result if every filed is filled in appropriately. On the contrary, if some fields required to be filled are blank,
some error word would appear at the right side of the prices or in front of the delivery and take out. 

In addition, I also created a style.css in resources/css folder to stylize some elements in index.xhtml.
